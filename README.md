# Neural Network activation and initialisation choosing

This repository is used to commit my progress on my cassiopée project at Télécom SudParis (French engineering school). This project aim to study activation function in neural networks from a theorical point of view. We use a gaussian process modelisation to approximate an infinite neural network.

Based on Hayou et al On the Impact of the Activation Function on Deep Neural Networks Training (https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.06853)
